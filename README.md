# CFD
Inorder to better understand the equations of fluid flow I am trying to implement them in python, starting with relatively simple Laplace Equation "∇²φ = ∂²φ/∂x² + ∂²φ/∂y² = 0" on a backwards step.

Future steps will include pressure fields, viscosity and than the convection term. Until the navier stokes equation is close to being solved.
